    <h3> Summary: </h3>
    <p>
      The Great British Bake Off takes a group of amateur bakers from the UK to compete in a series of 3 challenges each week; the first challenge is the signature challenge. The second challenge is the technical and the third challenge is the showstopper. Each week 1 baker is eliminated and 1 baker is named star baker. At the end, the 3 finalists compete and 1 wins the title of best amateur baker. There are two judges, Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, and 2 hosts, Mel and Sue.

    <h3> The Signature Challenge: </h3>
    <p>
      In the signature challenge the bakers bake something that they would normally make for their friends and family.
    </p>

    <h3> The Technical Challenge: </h3>
    <p>
      In the technical challenge the judges choose a recipe that use skills they believe the bakers should have and give a basic recipe. The bakers have no idea what the recipe is going in to the challenge and must rely on their knowledge during the challenge. Sometimes the judges will choose recipes that are obscure and unheard of, but sometimes they choose recipes that they believe the bakers should know with even more bare-bones recipe.
    </p>

    <h3> The Showstopper: </h3>
    <p>
      In the showstopper the bakers have time to prepare their recipes and must include certain elements, such as including chocolate or sugar work.
